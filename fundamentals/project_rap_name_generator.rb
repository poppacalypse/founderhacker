# each method only does one thing. Easy for future maintenance and enhancement.

# note: outer-scoped *methods* can be invoked within another method. Only variables cannot. 
# because in a way, they are within the same scope. In this eg, both are defined within Scope A 

# Scope A
def pick_one words
  # Scope B (inner scope of pick_one)
  words.sample

# Scope A

# Constants ------------------------------------------
# one way to access an outer-scoped variable inside a method, is to use a constant
this = 'that' # variable assignment
THIS = 'THAT' # CONSTANT assignment i.e. a variable that is immutable 

# same as a variable, a CONSTANT needs to store value, but this value never needs to change 

HARD_CODED_SALUTATIONS = ['Sir']

def salutations2 # <-- don't have to pass it in
  HARD_CODED_SALUTATIONS # <-- just use it directly 
end

# so now we can refactor one more time. It might make more sense to use CONSTANT rather than def because basically we are just storing values.
